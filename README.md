# COVID infection during pregnancy on cardiovascular disease and related risk factors

## Project description

COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may increase the risk of cardiovascular health problems related to pregnancy and giving birth. Small hospital-based studies have suggested a relationship between COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and severe complications for mothers and their babies. However, since some complications are rare, detailed analyses from large population-based studies are required. Along with this, it is of great interest to understand the possible protective effect of vaccination against COVID-19 infection considering the increasing proportion of the population vaccinated against COVID-19 also among pregnant women.

We will assess and quantify the role of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy on cardiovascular-related maternal health outcomes (for example, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, peripartum cardiomyopathy), and on longer-term cardiovascular related diseases for the mother and child.

Results from our study will help to inform women on potential risks related to COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, identify women with greatest risks, understand the possible protective effect of vaccination against COVID-19 infection, and help evaluate if any preventative interventions are needed.
